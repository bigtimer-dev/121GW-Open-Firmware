@ diskio.s - SD module: the disk layer that FatFs calls, the card bring-up and the card power-off (DESIGN.md 6.23, W8)
@
@ The routines disk_initialize, disk_status, disk_read, disk_write, disk_ioctl and get_fattime are the FatFs low-level
@ interface (diskio) of drive 0, the SD card.  Sector size is 512 bytes; read and write address the card by byte address
@ (sector * 512, the SDHC conversion to block numbers is done by sd_read_block and sd_write_blocks).  Every transfer is
@ followed by polling the card state with CMD13 (sd_get_status) up to 20000 times until it is back in the transfer state.
@ sd_bringup and sd_probe_mount are the "bring-up" that the log session and cal.bin run before opening files.
@
@ Deviation of this file: OF-42 (disk_read honours the sector count).

@ OF-66: one sector for the DMA when the caller's buffer is not word aligned.  The SDIO DMA (DMA2 channel 4) moves words
@ and RM0038 11.4.5 / 11.4.6 align every access down to the item size ("access is automatically aligned"), so a transfer
@ to or from an address that is not a multiple of 4 lands 1..3 bytes off.  FatFs passes the caller's own buffer for
@ whole sectors (f_read / f_write of a run that starts or ends inside a sector: the middle part goes straight to
@ disk_read / disk_write), and nothing in FatFs or the API makes that buffer aligned.
