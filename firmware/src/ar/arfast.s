@ arfast.s - AR: the production auto-range primitives (IMP-01): ar_apply and ar_sample
@
@ New routines (no v2.05 function).  autorange_step (autorange.s) keeps the v2.05 decision once per mean in both
@ loop modes; the routines here add what analysis/autorange_and_scheduler.md 5 specifies for the production image:
@
@   ar_apply(mode, range)   called at the end of every apply (fn_0800DB48): clears the overload latch 0x200080F8
@                           (OF-20) and, in the production image, resets the per-sample state and computes the
@                           number of conversions to discard after the change (settle profile CP, or TP for the
@                           families enabled in config.inc: ARS 5.2 P4)
@   ar_sample(value, raw)   called by MDC / MAC / MRES after each conversion: per-sample over- and under-range
@                           detection with K = 2 confirmation and saturation test (ARS 5.2 P2), direct target range
@                           (ARS 5.2 P3), and the conversion discard of P4.  Production image only; the baseline
@                           image (LOOP_V205 = 1) keeps the v2.05 algorithm alone and ar_sample accepts everything.
@
@ Why the final range equals the one v2.05 reaches (ARS 5.1 invariant 1): v2.05 moves one range per decision and
@ re-measures; every range is ten times the previous one in counts (the table 0x08025A3C: 50 000 counts per range
@ except DCV range 3 = 6 000, ACA / DCA range 2 = 10 000, CAP = 10 000), so the reading of range j is the reading of
@ the present range c scaled by 10^(c - j).  The one exception is CAP range 5 against range 4 (hundred times: range 5
@ shows 9999 uF without decimals, range 4 100.00 uF, hy3131_modes_misc.md 5.5), handled in the down search.  Going up v2.05 stops at the lowest j > c with |v_j| <= U_j, going down
@ at the highest j < c with |v_j| >= L_j (or 0); the routines compute exactly that j from one confirmed sample.  The
@ sample is an estimate with an uncertainty of one count, so a candidate that the uncertainty leaves undecided is
@ resolved towards the present range (lower j going up, higher j going down): never an overshoot, and the normal rule
@ continues from there as v2.05 would.
