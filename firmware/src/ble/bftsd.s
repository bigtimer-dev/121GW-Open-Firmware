@ bftsd.s - BLE: SD card file requests over the Bluetooth transfer link (list, read, delete, free space)
@ (production image only, DESIGN.md 10 IMP-36, FEATURES.md 2.11 stage 6)
@
@ The companion app can look at the card without removing it: list the root directory, read a file in pieces, delete a
@ file and ask for the free space.  The requests ride on the packet framing of the firmware transfer (ble/bft.s: B5 5B
@ type seq(2) len(1) payload(len <= 232) crc16(2), little-endian, CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE over type..payload) and are handed
@ over by bft_packet (types 0x10 .. 0x17), so they are possible only under the gate of the transfer (bft_poll): the
@ SETUP page Ld shown, Bluetooth on, logging off, calibration mode off.  Outside that gate the link belongs to the v2.05
@ parser and a request is not seen at all (no answer).  Types 0x16 / 0x17 (settings) are in ble/bftset.s.
@
@ Requests (payload):
@     0x10 LIST    start(2)                          root directory, entries start .. , as many as fit in 232 bytes
@     0x11 READ    namelen(1) name offset(4) len(2)  len 1 .. 8192: read into the staging buffer (log_buf, 8 KiB)
@     0x12 CHUNK   idx(2)                            bytes idx*232 .. of the staged data (RAM only, no card access)
@     0x13 DELETE  namelen(1) name                   f_unlink of one root file (or empty directory)
@     0x14 INFO    -                                 free and total clusters, cluster size
@ Answer: B5 5B 82 seq(2) len(1) status(1) field(2) data crc16(2); seq = the request's seq, len = 3 + length of data,
@     data <= 232 bytes, so an answer is at most 8 + 3 + 232 = 243 bytes (one Bluetooth write of 244 bytes; the transmit
@     queue ble_txq of usart.s holds 256).  field and the data per request:
@     LIST   field = count of entries | 0x8000 when the end of the directory was reached.  data = count entries of
@            size(4) fdate(2) ftime(2) attr(1) namelen(1) name(namelen).  size = low 32 bits of the file size (0xFFFFFFFF
@            above 4 GiB), fdate / ftime = the FAT date and time words, attr = the FAT attribute byte; a name of more
@            than 63 bytes (long file name, FF_MAX_LFN 255) is cut to 63 bytes and bit 7 of attr is set (the FAT
@            attributes use bits 0..5 only).  The name is the long file name, or the 8.3 name if there is none.  An
@            entry that does not fit in the answer is not counted: the next LIST (start += count) returns it first.
@     READ   field = number of bytes read (below len at the end of the file; 0 at or after the end), data = CRC-32
@            (IEEE 802.3, as zlib.crc32) of those bytes, 4 bytes.  The bytes stay in the staging buffer for CHUNK until
@            the next READ or the next START of a firmware transfer.
@     CHUNK  field = idx, data = the 232 bytes idx*232 .. of the staged data (fewer in the last chunk).
@     DELETE field = 0, no data.
@     INFO   field = sectors per cluster (512 bytes each), data = free clusters(4) total clusters(4).  A card whose free
@            count is not known to the file system needs a scan of the allocation table: the answer can take seconds.
@     status 0 accepted; 3 not allowed now (a firmware transfer fills the staging buffer, a restart is due, or the type
@     is unknown); 0x20 not found (FatFs FR_NO_FILE or FR_NO_PATH); 0x21 name refused; 0x22 argument refused (payload
@     length, len or idx out of range); 0x23 protected (DELETE of cal.bin, EEVBlog.bin or BTLOAD.TMP); 0x24 card error,
@     field = step << 8 | FatFs result (step 1 open / opendir, 2 seek, 3 read / readdir, 4 delete, 5 getfree / close).
@     (Statuses 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the transfer answers are not used here: a CRC error is answered with the 0x81 answer.)
@ Names: 1 .. 63 bytes out of A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ space -, no "..", no space at either end and no dot at the end (FatFs
@     removes trailing spaces and dots from a name, so "cal.bin." would reach cal.bin).  The path given to FatFs is "0:"
@     and the name: the root directory only.  Names are matched without regard to case, as FatFs does, also for the
@     protected names.  There is no write, rename, format or mkdir, and no EEPROM access of any kind in this module.
@
@ Card session.  Every card access is one session exactly as the firmware transfer does it (bft_card_begin / end of
@ bft.s): system clock HSE, SDIO up, drive registered, the operation, SDIO off, run clock.  The link is deaf meanwhile
@ (usart.s, NF-04); the sender waits for the answer (stop and wait).  A failing session is not repeated here: the answer
@ says 0x24 and the sender asks again.
@
@ RAM: the FatFs objects of the transfer (ff16_fatfs, ff16_fil_a, ff16_dir_a, ff16_finfo) and the staging buffer (log_buf,
@ as bft.s), which belong to logging and cal.bin, neither of which can run meanwhile (the gate).  Added here: bfx_ans
@ (248 bytes), bfx_path (68), bfx_staged (2) in .bss_port.
@
@ Context: main only (bft_packet).
