@ =============================================================================
@ bft.s - BLE: file transfer over Bluetooth to the SD card, for a firmware update without removing the card
@ (production image only, DESIGN.md 10 IMP-28, FEATURES.md 2.10)
@
@ The bootloader programs only EEVBlog.bin from the card, and only when the update keys are held at power-on
@ (FEATURES.md 2.10); the application never writes flash.  This module receives a file over the Bluetooth link and
@ writes it to the card: first to a temporary file, then, only after its length and CRC-32 match what the sender
@ announced and its first two words look like an application image, it is copied to EEVBlog.bin and that copy is read
@ back and checked again, and the temporary file is deleted.  A broken or refused transfer never touches EEVBlog.bin; a copy
@ that fails in every attempt deletes the EEVBlog.bin it had begun, so that no part of an image is left to program.  (A
@ rename of the temporary file is not used: R0.16 f_rename writes the new entry before it removes the old one, and a card
@ error between the two writes leaves two entries on one cluster chain.)
@
@ Consent and state.  The transfer is possible only while the SETUP page Ld (setup item 39, after the page bt) is shown
@ with Bluetooth on, logging off and outside calibration mode (bft_poll).  The sub display shows "Ld-bt" (waiting),
@ "Ld nn" (nn = percent received), "Ld oK" (EEVBlog.bin written and verified) or "LdE n" (error n, below).  Leaving the
@ page ends the transfer; the meter keeps measuring meanwhile.  While the page is active the status frames are not sent
@ (ble_tx_start_frame) and the USART2 handler passes every received byte to the ring bft_ring (bft_rx_byte) instead of
@ the v2.05 key / clock parser.
@
@ Protocol (all multi-byte fields little-endian).  Packet: B5 5B type seq(2) len(1) payload(len <= 232) crc16(2); the
@ CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE (poly 0x1021, init 0xFFFF) covers type, seq, len and the payload.  One packet fits one Bluetooth
@ write (244 bytes, MTU 247: measured on a meter, 2026-11-03).  The sender waits for the answer to every packet
@ (stop and wait), so nothing is in flight while the card is written (the link is deaf then: usart.s, NF-04).
@     type 0x01 START  payload size(4) crc32(4): size 0x124 .. 0x4C000 (vector table .. image limit of the linker
@                      script); a new transfer, expected seq 0
@     type 0x02 DATA   seq = packet number from 0, payload = the next bytes of the file
@     type 0x03 END    all bytes sent: flush, check, copy, check the copy
@     type 0x04 ABORT  back to waiting
@     type 0x05 STATUS payload index(1): a diagnosis value in the answer's "next" field (bft_diag_tab)
@ Answer: B5 5B 81 seq(2) 03 status next(2) crc16(2), seq = the packet answered, next = the packet number expected
@     (with status 0x11 instead: the failed step << 8 | its FatFs result, step 1 open, 2 seek, 3 write, 4 short write,
@     5 close; with status 0 to END: the number of failed card sessions that were repeated successfully).
@     status 0 accepted; 1 CRC wrong (resend); 2 not the expected packet (send "next"); 3 not allowed in this state;
@     4 START refused (size); 5 bytes beyond the announced size; 0x10 + n: END failed with error n (below)
@ Errors (shown "LdE n"): 1 the card could not be written; 2 length or CRC-32 of the received file wrong; 3 not an
@     application image (initial SP outside the RAM, reset vector outside 0x08006000..0x08051FFF or not Thumb);
@     4 the copy to EEVBlog.bin failed; 5 the copy read back differs (after 4 or 5 no EEVBlog.bin is left once an
@     open for writing was tried); 6 the received file could not be read back.
@     Bootloader install (START kind 1, bft_install): 7 the bootloader area is not one of EEVblog's builds (nothing
@     written); 8 battery low or below 4.80 V (nothing written); 9 the install file or a flash step failed.  After
@     status 0 to END the meter restarts and the starter installs the bootloader (bootloader/DESIGN.md 6.4).
@     START payload: size(4) crc32(4) [kind(1)]: kind 0 or absent = firmware file (EEVBlog.bin), 1 = install file.
@ Buffers: the received bytes are collected in log_buf (8 KiB of its 10000 bytes, 0x20001240..0x2000394F; 0x20003950 is
@ the BLE value ring, written all the time) and written to the card
@ when the next packet might not fit; the card work uses the FIL objects of the log (log_fil, log_fil_new) and the
@ FATFS area fat_fs_obj.  All of them belong to logging and to cal.bin, which cannot run meanwhile (logging is refused,
@ cal.bin needs calibration mode).
@
@ Context: main only, except bft_rx_byte (USART2 interrupt).
