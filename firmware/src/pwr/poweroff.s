@ enter_stop_and_reinit - "-oFF-" with a 1 s beep, power down, STOP, then the full start-up again

@ In/Out   : - / -
@ Clobbers : r0-r3, r12, flags
@ Context  : main (loop step 14, request 0x2000803A)

@ Spec     : DESIGN.md 3.6
@ Deviation: HW-08 (TIM2/TIM3 update interrupts off and buzzer silenced before the power-down; v2.05 stops the
@            timers only at 0x0801C92E, after power_down_peripherals cleared PE7 at 0x0801C58C), NF-05 (in
@            fn_080207CC), NF-06 (EXTI lines and their NVIC enables off after the wake-up; v2.05 leaves them on),
@            IMP-06 (production: the 1 s beep as a state machine stepped with WFI between the steps; PWR_CR LPSDSR
@            cleared after the wake so the production WFI sleep is the normal Sleep mode)
