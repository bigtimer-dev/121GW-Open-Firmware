@ dcvavg.s - MDC: DCV averaging with a sliding window and a restart on a step (production image only, DESIGN.md 10 IMP-23)
@
@ v2.05 shows DCV as the mean of non-overlapping blocks of 16 AD1 samples (ad1_accumulate_average): one value per 16
@ samples (200 ms at the 80 sps DCV rows, hy3131_model.md 3), and a block that a step falls into mixes the old and the new
@ level (a 0 -> 9 V step can show 4.5 V once).  In DCV, outside calibration mode, the production image instead:
@   - publishes a mean every 8 samples, the mean of the last 16 (this half block and the previous one): the same 16-sample
@     window, so the same noise as v2.05, at twice the update rate;
@   - restarts the window on a step (second form, GitHub issue 3): a sample more than MDC_DCV_STEP raw codes away from the last sample
@     taken into the window is held back, and the next sample decides: within MDC_DCV_STEP of the held one = a step, a new
@     block starts with those two samples and arms the 4-sample first mean of IMP-01 (mdc_first_mean), so the first value
@     after a step is the mean of 4 new samples and no straddled mean is shown; back within MDC_DCV_STEP of the last taken
@     sample = the held one was a spike, it is left out and changes nothing; far from both = the input moves faster than
@     MDC_DCV_STEP per sample (a steep ramp, no level to restart on), both samples are taken into the window as v2.05
@     takes every sample.  So every sample is decided within one sample.  After a restart no further step is taken
@     until a mean has been published (mdc_dcv_pub): a sample stream whose changes keep crossing MDC_DCV_STEP (a slope
@     near the threshold, noise on it, a staircase input) cannot restart the window again and again, so a mean comes out at
@     least every MDC_DCV_HALF samples and the settle count after a range change, which counts published means, runs out.
@     (The first form compared a sample with the mean of the running half block, which lags a ramp by up to 4 samples of
@     its slope: on a ramp steeper than about MDC_DCV_STEP / 2 per sample every block restarted before it published, and the
@     display and the log held one value for seconds, GitHub issue 3, 0-4 V sine of 40 s period.)
@   - a mean published while the v2.05 settle count still runs (it is discarded) is not kept as the previous half block, so
@     no displayed window contains a sample of the settling time: after a range change the first value is the 4-sample mean
@     of IMP-01, then an 8-sample mean, then the 16-sample window, all from samples v2.05 also takes as settled.
@ MDC_DCV_STEP = 8192 codes: every DCV range spans 50000 counts with about 83.9 codes per count (the AD1 full scale of
@ the row; emulator, synthetic calibration: 83.89 in ranges 0, 1 and 2), so the threshold is about 98 counts, far above
@ the sample noise and far below the steps it is meant for.  A configuration change (fn_0800B974) empties the window.
@ Custom build CF-05 (re-done on the second form): the step threshold follows the noise of the input:
@ max(MDC_DCV_STEP, 6 x mdc_dcv_mad), where mdc_dcv_mad is the running mean of |sample - last taken sample| over the
@ samples within the threshold (exponential average 1/8; about 1.13 sigma for Gaussian noise, so the threshold is about
@ 6.8 sigma of the sample noise, 4.8 sigma of the difference of two samples).  With the fixed threshold a noisy source
@ (aliased ripple, about 0.6 x 98 counts sigma or more) restarted the window on noise pairs, so many published values
@ were 4-sample means: in the emulator at 60 / 120 counts sigma per sample the display showed 1.9 / 1.7 times v2.05's
@ standard deviation.  A clean source keeps mad far below the fixed threshold, so the step response above is unchanged
@ there; a step smaller than about 6.8 sigma of the noise is averaged as in v2.05.  Spikes and samples far from both
@ (a steep ramp) do not feed the estimate.  The configuration change resets mad to 0.
@ Calibration mode keeps v2.05's blocks of 16 (the captures of CAL average the published means).
@
@ Context: main only.
