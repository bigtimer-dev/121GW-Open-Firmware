"""121GW emulator core: Cortex-M3 CPU (Unicorn), memory map, exception engine, virtual clock.

Execution model
- The CPU runs in slices.  Between slices the run loop delivers pending exceptions and advances
  peripheral events on the virtual clock.
- Virtual clock: a block hook adds the core clock cycles of each translated block when the block is entered: the
  Cortex-M3 cycle estimate of its instructions (emu/cycles.py, computed once per translated block with Capstone) plus
  the pipeline refill of a taken branch when the block is not entered from the end of the block before.  A block left
  before its end (slice limit, emu_stop from a hook or MMIO callback, WFI/WFE, MPU fault) is corrected when the CPU
  stops (_settle): the cycles of the instructions from the stop address to the block end are taken off again, because
  Unicorn resumes at that address as a new translated block that is counted on entry.  Every executed instruction is
  thus counted exactly once.  Inside a block the clock reads the value at the block end; a slice ends at the first
  block start at or after its end cycle (or earlier, at the Unicorn instruction count), so an event is handled at most
  one block late.  The clock never goes back behind a value a peripheral access has seen (_vis): a correction that
  would do so is kept as prepaid cycles (_prepay), taken from the next charges instead (_charge / _refund).
- Exception entry is done here (ARMv7-M: 8-word frame, EXC_RETURN in LR).  Exception return is the
  Unicorn M-class "exception exit" interrupt (intno 8): the frame is popped here and execution resumes.
- WFI/WFE: Unicorn rejects them as invalid instructions; run() catches that and emulates the sleep (_sleep,
  semantics in add_idle_hook), at no cost to code that does not sleep.
- IT state: Unicorn can report a stale ITSTATE after an IT block has ended; the IT bits stacked at an exception
  entry and those a slice starts with are the architectural state at the PC (it_state_at), never Unicorn's alone.
