"""Meter front end for the HY3131 model: turns the user's stimulus at the test jacks into the voltages at the
HY3131 pins (and the signal at its counter input).

Two backends, chosen at construction with make_frontend(kind, ...):

(a) "netlist"     NetlistFrontend: solves analysis/frontend_netlist.cir with ngspice (emu/spice.py).  What the
                  netlist must provide is listed in the class docstring; a missing netlist, library, element or
                  undefined node is reported (FrontendUnavailable) instead of being replaced by anything else.
(b) "calibrated"  CalibratedFrontend: a perfectly calibrated unit.  By construction of the firmware's calibration
                  (spec 7.2) the averaged AD1 result of such a unit is raw = D * g + offset, with D the true value
                  in display counts and offset / g the EEPROM record of the active mode and range (spec 5.1, 5.4).
                  The backend computes that raw value from the stimulus and returns the pin voltages that make the
                  chip's transfer formula (DS p31) produce it.  It is the reference used to validate (a).

Stimulus (set_stimulus): {'kind': k, 'value': x, 'ac': bool, 'freq': Hz, 'duty': 0..1, 'width': s, 'dc': V,
                          'amps': A, 'board': degC or None, 'probe': 'K' | 'J' | 'T' | 'N' | 'R' | 'S'}
    kind 'V'      volts: the DC value, or with ac the RMS of a sine of `freq` Hz plus the DC component 'dc'
    kind 'A'      amperes (DC, or RMS of a sine with ac), entering through the plugged current jack (A or mA)
    kind 'ohm'    resistance (also continuity in BEEP)
    kind 'Hz'     a signal of `value` Hz at the counter input; duty = high fraction, or 'width' = high time in s
                  (overrides duty when > 0)
    kind 'F'      capacitance in farads
    kind 'degC'   thermocouple (hot junction) temperature; 'probe' selects the thermocouple type (default 'K')
    kind 'diode'  forward voltage of the device under test in volts
    kind 'VA'     voltage `value` and current 'amps' at the same time (both RMS with ac)
    kind 'open'   test leads open, nothing connected (the default): every field except 'board' is ignored; what
                  the meter then sees per mode is listed at OPEN_LEADS below
    duty          high fraction of the signal at the counter input (default 0.5)
    board         board temperature at the cold junction (degC); the application derives the PA4 thermistor
                  voltage from it.  None: the board temperature follows the PA4 voltage.

Environment (set_environment), NOT part of the meter: mains pickup on the open V jack.  An open-circuit source of
'pickup_v' V rms at 'pickup_hz' (50 or 60 Hz) behind a coupling capacitance 'coupling_pf' (a stray capacitance from
the test leads and V jack to mains wiring; environment choice) drives the V jack against the meter's input
impedance to COM (input_impedance(), netlist parts per dial position); 'drift' is the depth of the slow amplitude
variation (a lead or a hand moving near the wiring; environment model, seeded from the chip seed).  pickup_v = 0 is a
shielded / pickup-free environment.  ENV_DEFAULT holds the defaults, all of them environment choices.  A connected
stimulus shunts the pickup by its source impedance: ideal sources (V, VA, Hz) are 0 ohm, so the pickup at the jack
is 0; a resistor ('ohm') or capacitor ('F') is in parallel with the input impedance; 'degC' (thermocouple) and
'diode' are taken as 0 ohm; 'A' leaves the V jack open (the current modes do not use it).  Where the pickup acts:
  AC rows (ACV, ACmV, LowZ AC variant, AC VA voltage channel): through the AD8436 path; the reading is its RMS
  counter inputs: CNT (FREQ / PULSE / DUTY) and the PB<4> comparator (ACV / ACmV) toggle only when the pickup swing
  at the pin crosses both thresholds (counter_input)
  DC rows: not applied.  The DCV, LowZ DC, DCmV / TEMP and DC VA rows set AD1CHOP = 1x (spec 3), whose response to
  an AC input the datasheet does not state (DS p30 (2); emu/hy3131.py module docstring: the comb itself is sinc^2,
  DS p30 figure).

Noise (both backends, per AD1 conversion, drawn by the chip with its seedable RNG):
- Reference: ADR3412 output noise density 0.6 uV/sqrt(Hz) typ at 1 kHz (ADR3412 Table 3), integrated over the
  Nyquist band of the AD1 output samples (rate / 2).  The integration band is a design choice; the 0.1-10 Hz
  figure (8 uV p-p typ) is not used because the datasheet gives no p-p to rms conversion.
- Unspecified converter / front-end noise: the HY3131 datasheet states no noise figure (only the zero reading
  -1..+1 count at 5 sps, DS p12; spec 6).  NOISE_COUNTS (default 0.5 display count sigma per sample) is a design
  choice, as proposed in spec 6: it is converted to raw LSB with the active record's gain g.
- Resistor thermal noise: ngspice noise analysis in backend (a) only.
- AD1 zero drift and linearity: DS p12 gives bounds only (drift typ 0; linearity max +-(0.01 % + 2 counts) with
  no transfer curve), so nothing is added; the chip exposes the drift as a parameter (typ 0).

    response (AC frequency correction, 1 kHz filter, OHM r5/r6, DIODE 15 V, VA burden correction, DC VA current

    response that correction was made for: the spec's inverse is evaluated at the stimulus' true frequency and value,
